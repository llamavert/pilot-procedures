## Adelaide (YPAD)
### Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Runway | Aircraft Type | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RWY 05 or 23 | Jets | AREPA | AREPA SID |
| RWY 05 or 23 | Jets | AVDEN | AVDEN SID |
| RWY 05 or 23 | Jets | BENDO | BENDO SID |
| RWY 05 or 23 | Jets | GILES | GILES SID |
| RWY 05 or 23 | Jets | UPROT | UPROT SID |
| RWY 05 | Jets | ORBUN | ORBUN SID |

Jet aircraft departing from RWY 05 or 23 not planned via a waypoint above can expect to be *rerouted* in accordance with the table above. All other aircraft shall expect the **AD (RADAR) SID**.

### Arrivals
An ILS is only available to RWY 23. RNP and VOR approaches are available to all runways. RNP(AR) approaches are available to RWY 05.

Jet aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR. Non-jet aircraft can expect to be processed either via a STAR (terminating on an instrument approach or with vectors to the IAF) or tracking DCT AD with the expectation of joining the circuit.

Where instrument approaches are required, the following approaches are generally used:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 05 | RNP(AR) or RNP if unable |
| 12 | RNP |
| 23 | ILS |
| 30 | RNP |

### Taxiing
Where an aircraft will be taxiing via multiple taxiways of the same lettering (e.g. A6, then A5, then A4, etc), they will generally be referred to by the letter only.

!!! example
    An aircraft taxiing from the terminal to RWY 05 could be instructed to taxi "via Alpha, cross runway 30, Foxtrot, to holding point Foxtrot Six runway 05".

## Parafield (YPPF)
### Airspace
PF ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the PF CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

When ADC West is online, the airspace is divided down the middle of the two active extended runway centerlines.

### Departures
VFR aircraft shall depart the zone via the SUB or SKI departure.

| Departure Runway | SUB Departure | SKI Departure |
| -- | -- | -- |
| RWY 03R | From upwind, track direct to SUB, climb to A015. | From left crosswind, track south of Bolivar Strobe to SKI, climb to A010. |
| RWY 08L | From left crosswind, track direct to SUB, climb to A010. Once north of PF, climb to A015. | From left downwind, track south of Bolivar Strobe to SKI, climb to A010. |
| RWY 21R | From left downwind, track direct to SUB, climb to A010. Once east of PF, climb to A015. | From right crosswind, track south of Bolivar Strobe to SKI, climb to A010. |
| RWY 26R | From right crosswind, track direct to SUB, climb to A010. Once north of PF, climb to A015. | From upwind, track south of Bolivar Strobe to SKI, climb to A010. |

Pilots must advise ADC of intended departure procedure on first contact.

!!! phraseology
    **WHB**: "Parafield Tower, Cessna 172 WHB, holding point J1 RWY 08L, for SUB departure, ready"

!!! note
    A takeoff clearance constitutes a clearance to depart the control zone by extending the pilot's requested leg of the circuit.  Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. **No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft**.

Pilots may request departure into the overlying Class C CTA through an explicit airways clearance. This may be available (pending traffic) on track to the first filed waypoint or via the Hope Valley [VFR Route](#hope-valley-route).

### Arrivals
VFR aircraft should report inbound at OHB, DMW, or EDN (outside EDN tower hours) at `A015`, and expect to be instructed to join the circuit.

Pilots inbound via OHB must remain south of Bolivar Strobe. Pilots must remain clear of the SUB-SPR and PF-SKI tracks due to outbound aircraft.

### IFR Operations
#### Departures
IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with the **PF (RADAR) SID** from RWY 03L or 21R.

By day VMC, pilots may request a visual departure.

#### Arrivals
An RNP & NDB approach is available to RWY 21R. A VOR approach is available to the circling area.

By day VMC, pilots should expect to arrive in accordance with [VFR Arrivals](#arrivals_1).

### Taxiing
The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions.

!!! tip
    The YPPF Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/parafield-manoeuvring-area-map).

The undershoots of RWY 26L & 26R on taxiway B require a clearance to cross.

## VFR Operations
### Coastal Flights
VFR aircraft may plan to transit the AD CTR tracking coastal, generally not above `A005`. Pilots should file a flight plan in accordance with the route advice below:

| Direction | Route |
| --- | --- |
| North | `PNL BTJ HNL OHB` |
| South | `OHB HNL BTJ PNL` |

Expect to be issued with a clearance limit which will laterally separate you with aircraft operating at YPAD. You must not pass beyond the designated clearance limit until in receipt of an onwards clearance.

!!! phraseology
    **CEY:** "Adelaide Approach, CEY, Cessna 172, 4nm south of PNL, 1,000ft, received charlie, request coastal northbound"  
    **AD TCU:** "CEY, Adelaide Approach, squawk 0542, remain clear of class C airspace"  
    **CEY:** "Squawk 0542, remain OCTA, CEY"   

    **AD TCU:** "CEY, identified, cleared coastal offshore northbound, not above 500ft, clearance limit BTJ"  
    **CEY:** "Cleared coastal offshore northbound, not above 500ft, clearance limit BTJ, CEY"

In the majority of cases, AD TCU will transfer pilots to AD ADC who will manage the transit of the extended runway centreline. Where a delay is required, pilots can expect to be instructed to hold at the clearance limit.

!!! phraseology 
    **CNY:** "Adelaide Tower, CNY, maintaining not above 500ft"  
    **AD ADC:** "CNY, Adelaide Tower, hold at the clearance limit, expect onwards clearance in 5 minutes due inbound traffic"  
    **CNY:** "Hold at the clearance limit, CNY"  

When onwards clearance is available, it will be issued by ADC.

!!! phraseology 
    **AD ADC:** "CNY, cancel clearance limit, track coastal offshore northbound, not above 500ft"  
    **CNY:** "Cancel clearance limit, track coastal offshore northbound, not above 500ft, CNY"

### Hope Valley Route
A VFR [Lane of Entry](../airspace/lanesofentry.md) is established leading from the PF CTR to MLT, contained entirely inside the AD CTR. **A clearance is required to operate on this route**. 

Pilots may be instructed to sight and maintain own separation with aircraft operating into or outbound from YPAD.
