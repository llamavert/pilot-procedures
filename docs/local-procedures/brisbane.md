## Brisbane (YBBN)
### Taxiing
#### Standard Taxi Routes
Standard taxi routes exist to simplify issued taxi instructions. Unless explicit instructions are received, the following taxiways should be used in the directions indicated below:

| Taxiway | Direction of Travel |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Bravo | Opposite to Duty Runway |
| Alpha | Same Direction as Duty Runway |
| Yankee | Westbound |
| Zulu | Eastbound |

!!! warning "Important"
    SMC may provide instructions which contradict these standard taxi routes. Ensure you comply with any issued taxi instruction at all times.

#### SMC Frequency Change
Three SMC positions exist at Brisbane, all with different jurisdiction. Aircraft shall expect to hold short of predetermined taxiways. Domestic aircraft should independently transfer to the next SMC controller autonomously, while international aircraft may expect an explicit frequency change from the current SMC.

#### Preferred Runway Exits
The AIRPORT EFFICIENCY PROCEDURES chart dictates preferred runway exits for pilots to vacate at. This ensures a predictable, efficient movement of aircraft on the aerodrome and should be abided by where possible. Where a preferred exit is not assured, pilots must inform ADC.

| Runway | Aircraft Type | Preferred Exits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RWY 19L | Turboprop Prop, Jet <br> Jet, Heavy | A6 <br> A7 |
| RWY 01R | Turboprop Prop, Jet <br> Jet, Heavy | A4S <br> A4 <br> A3 |
| RWY 19R | Turboprop Prop <br> Jet <br> Heavy | T7 <br> T9 <br> T11 |
| RWY 01L | Turboprop Prop <br> Jet <br> Heavy | T8 <br> T6 <br> T4 |

### Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jets | All | BIXAD | BIXAD SID |
| Jets | RWY 01R or 19L | SANEG | SANEG SID |
| Jets | RWY 01R or 19L | SCOTT | SCOTT SID |
| Jets | RWY 01R or 19L | GUMKI | GUMKI SID |
| Jets | RWY 01R, 19L, or 19R | WACKO | WACKO SID |

All other aircraft shall expect the **BN (RADAR) SID**.

### Arrivals

An ILS, RNP, and RNP(AR) is available for all runways. 

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| RWY 19L | ILS |
| RWY 01R | ILS |
| RWY 19R | ILS |
| RWY 01L | ILS |

### Helicopter Operations
#### Waypoints

In VMC, all helicopters shall expect to be processed via two visual waypoints (outlined below) positioned north and south of the field. Where VMC does not exist, IFR helicopters will conform to fixed wing ops and expect to be processed via the BN (RADAR) SID from an appropriate runway.

| Direction of Flight  | Inbound/Outbound Tracking Point |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| North      | BLHS   |
| South      | MBHM   |
| East      | MBHM   |
| West      | BLHS   |

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU533:** "Brisbane Delivery, helicopter RSCU533, MEDEVAC, for YXHE, request clearance"  
    **BN ACD:** "RSCU533, Brisbane Delivery, cleared to YXHE via amended BLHS, YXHE, climb A025, squawk 1256, departure frequency 124.7"  
    **RSCU533:** "Cleared to YXHE via amended BLHS, YXHE, climb A025, squawk 1256, departures 124.7, RSCU533"

#### Departures

Both taxiways **H2** and **F4** are inside the maneuvering area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance from BN ADC. Helicopters departing on other surfaces outside the maneuvering areas will be instructed to *"report airborne"*. 

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU533:** "Brisbane Tower, helicopter RSCU533, Taxiway H2 ready"  
    **BN ADC:** "RSCU533, Brisbane Tower, Taxiway H2 cleared for takeoff"  
    **RSCU533:** "Taxiway H2 cleared for takeoff, RSCU533"
 
    **BN ADC:** "RSCU533, contact departures"  
    **RSCU533:** "Departures, RSCU533"


#### Arrivals

Helicopters arriving to YBBN during VMC shall expect to be cleared by via the [appropriate inbound waypoint](#waypoints), with that waypoint issued as the clearance limit. 

Depending on the current traffic situation, pilots may expect an instruction to hold and/or maintain own separation with any arriving or departing aircraft, If holding is required prior to arrival, helicopters shall be instructed to hold at the following positions:

| Inbound Via | Holding Position |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| BLHS        | Brisbane Entertainment Centre *(3nm northwest of runway 01L/19R)* |
| MBHM        | MBHM             |

!!! phraseology 
    **X6G**: "Brisbane Tower, helicopter X6G, for Taxiway F4"  
    **BN ADC**: "X6G, Brisbane Tower, cancel clearance limit, track to and hold at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, maintain A010"  
    **X6G**: "Cancel clearance limit, track to and hold at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, maintain A010, X6G"

    **BN ADC**: "X6G, report sighting, and able to maintain own separation with, a Qantas 737, 4nm final runway 19R"  
    **X6G**: "Traffic sighted, and we are able to maintain own separation. X6G"  
    **BN ADC**: "X6G, cancel hold, pass behind the 737, maintain own separation, caution wake turbulence, cleared visual approach Taxiway F4"  
    **X6G**: "Cancel hold, pass behind the 737, maintain own separation, cleared visual approach Taxiway F4, X6G"

Both taxiway **H2** and **F4** are inside the maneuvering area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance by BN ADC. Helicopters landing on other surfaces outside the maneuvering areas will be instructed to *"report on the ground"* so the controller knows when they you no longer active in their airspace.

!!! phraseology
    **BN ADC:** "X6G, Taxiway F4, cleared to land"  
    **X6G:** "Taxiway F4, cleared to land, X6G"

## Gold Coast (YBCG) TODO
### Airspace
CG ADC is responsible for the Class C Airspace within the CG CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

## Sunshine Coast (YBSU) TODO
### Airspace
SU ADC is responsible for the Class D Airspace within the SU CTR `SFC` to `A035`.

## Archerfield (YBAF)
### Airspace

When Archerfield ADC North is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC South takes responsibility for the South/East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10R**, **28L**, **04R**, **22L**).

ADC North takes responsibility for the North/West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10L**, **28R**, **04L**, **22R**).

### Taxiing

The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions. 
All aircraft require a clearance to cross RWY 04L & 04R on taxiway B.

!!! phraseology
    **BHK**: "Archer Ground, Archer BHK, Dual, received F, at Eastern Apron, request taxi for southern departure"    
    **AF SMC**: "BHK, Archer Ground, report approaching taxiway E"  
    **BHK**: "Report approaching E, BHK"        

    **BHK**: "BHK, approaching E"  
    **AF SMC**: "BHK, taxi E, B, cross runway 04R, 04L, holding point B6, runway 10L"   
    **BHK**: "Taxi E, B, cross runway 04R, 04L, holding point B6, runway 10L, BHK"   

!!! tip
    The YBAF Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/archerfield-manoeuvring-area-map).

!!! warning
    In some simulator scenery holding point **B6** is incorrect or entirely missing. If your scenery does not support this holding point, you must inform **AF SMC** when requesting taxi when RWY 10L is in use. 

### Departures

All VFR departures shall depart the AF CTR at `A10`.

- track xxx degrees / outbound procedures

!!! note 
    Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft.

!!! phraseology

    **AF ADC**: "R8489, Archer Tower, runway 10R, cleared for takeoff"      
    **R8489**: "Runway 10R, cleared for takeoff, R8489"  


### Arrivals

    **AF ADC**: "YQF, Archer Tower, join downwind, runway 10L, maintain A015"      
    **YQF**: "Join downwind, runway 10L, maintain A015, YQF"  

### Helicopter Operations

Archerfield has three helipads located around the aerodrome:

- **Central Helipad**, on the southern side of Taxiway Foxtrot
- **Northern Helipad**, adjacent the north-eastern end of Runway 04R/22L
- The **Queensland Government Air facility** used by rescue helicopters, north of Taxiway B5
