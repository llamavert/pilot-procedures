### Taxiing
#### Standard Taxi Routes
Standard taxi routes exist to simplify issued taxi instructions. Unless explicit instructions are received, the following taxiways should be used in the directions indicated below:

| Taxiway | Direction of Travel |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Bravo | Opposite to Duty Runway |
| Alpha | Same Direction as Duty Runway |
| Yankee | Westbound |
| Zulu | Eastbound |

!!! warning "Important"
    SMC may provide instructions which contradict these standard taxi routes. Ensure you comply with any issued taxi instruction at all times.

#### SMC Frequency Change
Three SMC positions exist at Brisbane, all with different jurisdiction. Aircraft shall expect to hold short of predetermined taxiways. Domestic aircraft should independently transfer to the next SMC controller autonomously, while international aircraft may expect an explicit frequency change from the current SMC.

#### Preferred Runway Exits
The AIRPORT EFFICIENCY PROCEDURES chart dictates preferred runway exits for pilots to vacate at. This ensures a predictable, efficient movement of aircraft on the aerodrome and should be abided by where possible. Where a preferred exit is not assured, pilots must inform ADC.

| Runway | Aircraft Type | Preferred Exits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RWY 19L | Turboprop Prop, Jet <br> Jet, Heavy | A6 <br> A7 |
| RWY 01R | Turboprop Prop, Jet <br> Jet, Heavy | A4S <br> A4 <br> A3 |
| RWY 19R | Turboprop Prop <br> Jet <br> Heavy | T7 <br> T9 <br> T11 |
| RWY 01L | Turboprop Prop <br> Jet <br> Heavy | T8 <br> T6 <br> T4 |

### Departures
VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jets | All | BIXAD | BIXAD SID |
| Jets | RWY 01R or 19L | SANEG | SANEG SID |
| Jets | RWY 01R or 19L | SCOTT | SCOTT SID |
| Jets | RWY 01R or 19L | GUMKI | GUMKI SID |
| Jets | RWY 01R, 19L, or 19R | WACKO | WACKO SID |

All other aircraft shall expect the **BN (RADAR) SID**.

### Arrivals

An ILS, RNP, and RNP(AR) is available for all runways. 

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| RWY 19L | ILS |
| RWY 01R | ILS |
| RWY 19R | ILS |
| RWY 01L | ILS |

### Helicopter Operations
#### Waypoints

In VMC, all helicopters shall expect to be processed via two visual waypoints (outlined below) positioned north and south of the field. Where VMC does not exist, IFR helicopters will conform to fixed wing ops and expect to be processed via the BN (RADAR) SID from an appropriate runway.

| Direction of Flight  | Inbound/Outbound Tracking Point |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| North      | BLHS   |
| South      | MBHM   |
| East      | MBHM   |
| West      | BLHS   |

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU533:** "Brisbane Delivery, helicopter RSCU533, MEDEVAC, for YXHE, request clearance"  
    **BN ACD:** "RSCU533, Brisbane Delivery, cleared to YXHE via amended BLHS, YXHE, climb A025, squawk 1256, departure frequency 124.7"  
    **RSCU533:** "Cleared to YXHE via amended BLHS, YXHE, climb A025, squawk 1256, departures 124.7, RSCU533"

#### Departures

Both taxiways **H2** and **F4** are inside the maneuvering area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance from BN ADC. Helicopters departing on other surfaces outside the maneuvering areas will be instructed to *"report airborne"*. 

!!! phraseology
    **RSCU533:** "Brisbane Tower, helicopter RSCU533, Taxiway H2 ready"  
    **BN ADC:** "RSCU533, Brisbane Tower, Taxiway H2 cleared for takeoff"  
    **RSCU533:** "Taxiway H2 cleared for takeoff, RSCU533"
 
    **BN ADC:** "RSCU533, contact departures"  
    **RSCU533:** "Departures, RSCU533"


#### Arrivals

Helicopters arriving to YBBN during VMC shall expect to be cleared by via the [appropriate inbound waypoint](#waypoints), with that waypoint issued as the clearance limit. 

Depending on the current traffic situation, pilots may expect an instruction to hold and/or maintain own separation with any arriving or departing aircraft, If holding is required prior to arrival, helicopters will be instructed to hold at the following positions:

| Inbound Via | Holding Position |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| BLHS        | Brisbane Entertainment Centre *(3nm northwest of runway 01L/19R)* |
| MBHM        | MBHM             |

!!! phraseology 
    **X6G**: "Brisbane Tower, helicopter X6G, for Taxiway F4"  
    **BN ADC**: "X6G, Brisbane Tower, cancel clearance limit, track to and hold at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, maintain A010"  
    **X6G**: "Cancel clearance limit, track to and hold at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, maintain A010, X6G"

    **BN ADC**: "X6G, report sighting, and able to maintain own separation with, a Qantas 737, 4nm final runway 19R"  
    **X6G**: "Traffic sighted, and we are able to maintain own separation. X6G"  
    **BN ADC**: "X6G, cancel hold, pass behind the 737, maintain own separation, caution wake turbulence, cleared visual approach Taxiway F4"  
    **X6G**: "Cancel hold, pass behind the 737, maintain own separation, cleared visual approach Taxiway F4, X6G"

Both taxiway **H2** and **F4** are inside the maneuvering area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance by BN ADC. Helicopters landing on other surfaces outside the maneuvering areas will be instructed to *"report on the ground"* so the controller knows when they you no longer active in their airspace.

!!! phraseology
    **BN ADC:** "X6G, Taxiway F4, cleared to land"  
    **X6G:** "Taxiway F4, cleared to land, X6G"

### Runway Configuration

The runway layout at YBSU has changed over the years. Pilots with old simulators/scenery may not have the newer Runway 13/31 config (replacing the old 18/36 config). If your scenery does not feature this updated runway configuration, you must inform ATC, who will try to facilitate your flight as best as possible.


## Archerfield (YBAF)
### Airspace
AF ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the AF CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

When Archerfield ADC North is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC South takes responsibility for the South/East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10R**, **28L**, **04R**, **22L**).

ADC North takes responsibility for the North/West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **10L**, **28R**, **04L**, **22R**).

### Taxiing

The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions. All aircraft require a clearance to cross RWY 04L & 04R on taxiway B.

!!! tip
    The YBAF Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/archerfield-manoeuvring-area-map).

!!! warning
    In some simulator scenery holding point **B6** is incorrect or entirely missing. If your scenery does not support this holding point, you must inform **AF SMC** when requesting taxi when RWY 10L is in use. 

### Departures

| Planned Departure Tracks | "Intentions"   | Tracking Requirement | 
| ---------------      | ---------      | ----------           | 
| BTN 310 & 019 DEG    | Northern Departure | Track via WTBG | 
| BTN 020 & 099 DEG    | Eastern <br> Departure  | Track via Gateway Motorway and Pacific Motorway Intersection<br>*(Not available when RWY 22 is active, unless departing into Class C)* | 
| BTN 100 & 204 DEG    | Southern Departure | Track 135 until clear of the zone |
| BTN 205 & 309 DEG    | Western Departure  | Track between 220 & 309 until clear of the zone<br>*(Aircraft must nominate outbound departure track with taxi call)* |
| Other                |                    | As approved by ATC

Aircraft shall advise planned departure intentions to AF SMC when requesting taxi.

!!! phraseology
    **BHK**: "Archer Ground, Archer BHK, Dual, received F, at Eastern Apron, for southern departure, request taxi"    
    **AF SMC**: "BHK, Archer Ground, report approaching taxiway E"  
    **BHK**: "Report approaching E, BHK"        

    **BHK**: "BHK, approaching E"  
    **AF SMC**: "BHK, taxi E, B, cross runway 04R, 04L, holding point B6, runway 10L"   
    **BHK**: "Taxi E, B, cross runway 04R, 04L, holding point B6, runway 10L, BHK"  

Aircraft shall confirm departure intentions to AF ADC on initial contact. All VFR departures shall depart the AF CTR at `A010`. 

!!! phraseology
    **R8489**: "Archer Tower, R8489, holding point A7, runway 10R, for eastern departure, ready"  
    **AF ADC**: "R8489, Archer Tower, runway 10R, cleared for takeoff"      
    **R8489**: "Runway 10R, cleared for takeoff, R8489"  

!!! note 
    Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft.

### Arrivals

Aircraft shall track via any designated VFR inbound reporting point at `A015`, thence contact AF ADC for clearance. Aircraft inbound via TVT may be instructed to report overhead CBRG, or via PKR, report overhead Logan Motorway. All Aircraft can expect to be instructed to join the circuit.

| VFR Waypoint  | Direction of Flight |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| TVT     | North  |
| PKR     | South  |
| TAR     | East   |
| GON     | West   |

!!! warning
    Caution must be exercised when tracking from PKR inbound YBAF, as Greenbank Firing Range restricted area (R627) is located a short distance to the west.

!!! phraseology
    **YQF**: "Archer Tower, YQF, Cirrus, TAR, A015, recieved Bravo, inbound fullstop"  
    **AF ADC**: "YQF, Archer Tower, join downwind, runway 10L, maintain A015"      
    **YQF**: "Join downwind, runway 10L, maintain A015, YQF"  
  
    **AF ADC**: "YQF, cleared visual approach"      
    **YQF**: "Cleared visual approach, YQF"  

If applicable, aircraft may be instructed to maintain `A015`, for separation with aircraft departing the zone `A010`. Once clear of the departure track, AF ADC will instruct aircraft "cleared visual approach", cancelling the previous level restriction.

### Helicopter Operations

Archerfield has three helipads located around the aerodrome:

- **Central Helipad**, on the southern side of Taxiway Foxtrot
- **Northern Helipad**, adjacent the north-eastern end of Runway 04R/22L
- The **Queensland Government Air facility** used by rescue helicopters, north of Taxiway B5

!!! note
    Both the Northern and Central helipads are inside the maneuvering area and treated like a runway, requiring a takeoff and landing clearance from AF ADC. Helicopters operating on other surfaces outside the maneuvering areas will be instructed to "report airborne" or "report on the ground" so the controllers knows when they are active/no longer active in their airspace.

##### Training Areas

There are 3 designated helicopter training areas which can be used for training operations in ground effect and circuits. The active helicopter training area shall be nominated on the ATIS.

=== "Area A"

    | Lateral Boundary | Vertical Limit  | Capacity     |
    | ------| ---- | --------|
    | North of Taxiway B within the confines of the aerodrome boundary, clear of all buildings  | Not above `A005`  | 3 helicopters in the circuit area, and additionally 2 helicopters in ground effect  |
