## Perth (YPPH)
### Taxiing
Two SMC positions exist which may sometimes be activated online. Everything west of RWY 03/21 is administered by SMC West, everything east of the runway is administered by SMC East.

### Departures
Depending on the active runway mode, the departure runway assigned to an aircraft may be dependent on the planned route.

VFR aircraft should expect to depart via a visual departure, on track to their first tracking point.

IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Aircraft Type | Runway | First Waypoint | SID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | All | OLMAM | OLMAM SID |
| All | All | OPEGA | OPEGA SID |
| All | All | SOLUS | SOLUS SID |
| Jets | All | AMANA | AMANA SID |
| Jets | All | AVNEX | AVNEX SID, or<br>EKEPO SID |
| Jets | All | HECTO | HECTO SID |
| Jets | All | MEMUP | MEMUP SID |
| Jets | All | MUBID | MUBID SID |
| Jets | All | YNRV | RAVENSTHORPE SID |
| Non-Jets | All | OTLED | OTLED SID, or<br>EKEPO SID |
| Non-Jets | All | REPOK | REPOK SID |
| Non-Jets | RWY 03 & 06 | LENVU | LENVU SID |
| Non-Jets | RWY 21 & 24 | PUMRY | PUMRY SID |

All other aircraft shall expect to be *rerouted* via the most appropriate SID terminus, or assigned the **PH (RADAR) SID**.

!!! note
    Reroutes are common for Non-Jet aircraft tracking to the east, planned via PUMRY. With RWY 03 and 06 as the duty runway, pilots can expect to be rerouted via LENVU and assigned the LENVU SID.

### Arrivals
An ILS is available to RWY 03, RWY 21, and RWY 24. RNP and VOR approaches are available to all runways. An RNP(AR) approach is available to RWY 03.

IFR aircraft can generally expect to be processed via a STAR terminating with the following approach:

| Runway | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| 03 | ILS or RNP(AR) |
| 06 | RNP |
| 21 | ILS |
| 24 | ILS |

The RWY 21 ILS is available from both straight in and from the DME arc. Advise ATS if you are not confident flying the arc.

During periods of good weather, aircraft may be cleared via the Victor STAR for a visual approach, to reduce their track miles.

### Preferred Runway Exits
The AIRPORT EFFICIENCY PROCEDURES chart dictates preferred runway exits for pilots to vacate at. This ensures a predictable, efficient movement of aircraft on the aerodrome and should be abided by where possible. Where a preferred exit is not assured, pilots must inform ADC.

| Runway | Aircraft Type | Preferred Exits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RWY 03 | Non-Jet<br>F100/E195/RJ1H and below | A6, C6 |
| RWY 03 | Jet above F100/E195/RJ1H | P, D |
| RWY 21 | Non-Jet<br>Light/Medium Jet | A6, C6 |
| RWY 21 | Heavy Jet | A7, C9 |
| RWY 24 | All | J1, A |

!!! note
    At YPPH, aircraft may vacate at an earlier exit without ATC approval. Preferred exits for RWY 06 are not published due infrequent use.

## Jandakot (YPJT)
### Airspace
JT ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the JT CTR `SFC` to `A015`.

When Jandakot ADC (Circuit) is online, responsibility for the **Runway**, **Circuit**, and **Airspace** is divided between the two ADC controllers.

ADC West takes responsibility for the North-West Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **06L/24R**), and the entire **JT CTR** at `A015`.

ADC (Circuit) takes responsibility for the South-East Runway, Circuit and Airspace (Runway **06R/24L**) at or below `A010`.

### Taxiing
The apron areas are outside the manoeuvring area. The runup bays and all connecting taxiways are inside the manoeuvring area, requiring taxi instructions.

!!! tip
    The YPJT Manoeuvring Area chart can be found on the [CASA Website](https://www.casa.gov.au/jandakot-manoeuvring-area-map).

### Departures
VFR aircraft shall generally depart the zone on an extended circuit leg at `A010`, except for those tracking via FREM.

Aircraft departing via FREM shall track from the circuit to *Fiona Stanley Hospital*, then climb to `A015` and track to FREM.

!!! note
    A takeoff clearance constitutes a clearance to depart the control zone by extending the pilot's requested leg of the circuit.  Aircraft departing the zone into Class G airspace should transfer to area frequency/advisory frequency upon leaving the zone. **No explicit frequency transfer will be given to these aircraft**.

### Arrivals
VFR aircraft should report inbound at BOAT, POWR, OAKF or RUSS at `A015`. JT ADC will instruct aircraft to maintain `A015` and report again at ADWD when inbound from BOAT or POWR, or FDL when inbound from OAKF or RUSS.

Aircraft should expect to join the circuit as below:

| VFR Approach Point | RWYs 06  | RWYs 24 | RWY 12 | RWY 30 |
| ----------------| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| ADWD   | *"Join base runway 06L"* | *"Join right downwind runway 24R, maintain A015"*, until the aircraft are clear of RWY 24R departures via *Fiona Stanley Hospital* and FREM, then *"Cleared Visual Approach"*  | *"Join final runway 12"* | *"Join downwind ruwnay 30, maintain A015"*, until the aircraft is clear of RWY 30 departures via YGB, then *"Cleared Visual Approach"* |
| FDL  | *"Join downwind runway 06L, maintain A015"*. Aircraft should fly overhead the airfield between the control tower and the upwind end of the runway and join the circuit. Once established in the circuit, *"Cleared visual approach"* | *"Join right downwind runway 24R, maintain A015"*. Aircraft should fly overhead the airfield between the control tower and the upwind end of the runway and join the circuit. Once established in the circuit, *"Cleared visual approach"* | *"Join right downwind runway 12"* | *"Join final runway 30"* |

All aircraft will arrive on runway **06L/24R** or **12/30**.

!!! note
    Circuit joining instructions given without an assigned altitude imply clearance to conduct the visual approach. Pilots may commence a visual approach while complying with any lateral instructions.

### IFR Operations
#### Departures
IFR aircraft should expect to be issued with a SID as per below:

| Departure Direction | SID   |
| -------| ----- |
| South/West    | TONEG SID |
| North/North-west    | ISPET SID |
| East/North-east    | SCARP SID |

By day VMC, pilots may request a visual departure.

#### Arrivals
STARs are available to segregate YPJT arrivals and YPPH traffic. Pilots may be cleared via a STAR or instructed to track direct to an IAF.

RNP approaches are available to RWY 06L, 24R, and 30. VOR and NDB approaches are available to the circling area.

By day VMC, pilots should expect to arrive in accordance with [VFR Arrivals](#arrivals_1).

## Scenic Flights
VFR aircraft may plan to conduct scenic flights within CTA in the PH TMA. A number of VFR routes exist to facilitate this, including:

| Name | Route | Preferred Altitude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Victor 65 | `CTE-PCTY-HKE` | At or below `A015` |
| Victor 66 | `TLMI-HRR-CDM` | At or below `A035` |

Aircraft wishing to conduct a scenic flight over the Perth CBD should expect to be cleared via the Victor 65 route.

!!! phraseology
    **VH-CYF:** "Perth Approach, CYF, Cessna 172, overhead FREM, A015, received Bravo, request Victor 65"  
    **PHA:** "CYF, squawk 0542, remain clear of class C airspace"  
    **VH-CYF:** "Squawk 0542, remain OCTA, CYF"  

    *When clearance (reference traffic into/out of YPPH) is available:*  
    **PHA:** "CYF, cleared Victor 65, maintain A015, QNH 1012"  
    **VH-CYF:** "Cleared Victor 65, maintain A015, QNH 1012, CYF"

## Terminal Airspace
Unlike other TMAs, the southern portion of the Perth TMA features a large cutout, with a CTA lower level of F125. Aircraft departing to or arriving from the south should expect to be cleared in accordance with the change in airspace.

!!! phraseology
    **PHD**: "RXA2125, leave and re-enter controlled airspace on climb to F180, no reported IFR traffic"  
    **RXA2125**: "Leave and re-enter controlled airspace on climb to F180, RXA2125"
